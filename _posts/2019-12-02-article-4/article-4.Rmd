| General topic?               | How an inflammation factor can influence tau proteins |
| Procedure/what was examined? | The function of the tau proteins is to help the stabilization of the neuron (the skeleton of the nerve cell). But when petients suffer of AD or/and FTD, a chemical reaction makes them stick together and separate themselves from the neuron.
Recently, scientists discovered the role played by a mechanism of inflammation in the production of toxic tau proteins. This mechanism includes the NLPR3 inflammasome protein complex.
The theory had been tested on postmortem brain samples and on cultured brain cells (as well as on mice).The study show the way tau proteins develops itself under the influence of the brainâ€™s immune system inflammatory process.
An hyperphosphorylated protein is a protein which is saturated in phosphate groups. The NLRP3 inflammasome active the hyperphosphorylation, so the tau proteins start beieng grouped all together because the hyperphosphorylation process makes it seperate from the cell scaffolds. There are two causes of Alzheimer's disease, beta-amyloid plaques and tau tangles proteins. The formation of beta-amyloid plaques begin in the early stages of AD, and at this moment, tau proteins are not all grouped together yet.  |
| Conclusions/discovery?       | There is a link between tau proteins and beta-amyloid plaques, which is the NLRP3 inflammasome. The consequences of this link are deposits of beta-amyloid, which are responsable of tau pathology that leads to cell apoptose. A new way to fight the disease could be the use of a drug that can target the process of hyperphosporilation, and thus tau pathology. |
| Remaining questions?         | There is no remaining questions |
