| General topic?               |  Tools that could help doctors in diagnosis of Alzheimer disease or other forms of dementia                      |
| Procedure/what was examined? | The topic of this article is the role of AI in diagnosis of disease like Alzheimer's disease (AD) or heart attacks. The part of the article that interest me is the one that talks about Alzheimer's disease. Researchers thinks that AI could improve in many way to diagnose AD. Diagnose AD is a complex task for doctors, indeed, there is too much factors to consider to make a correct diagnotic. In fact, AD is the most frequent form of dementia but not the only one, that's what makes the diagnotic difficult. To start the study, they used a database that belongs to HAPPYneuron and treated all the answers of all the poeple that took parts in the test. In florida, a second investigation was made. Researchers asked to poeple in five differents rural senior centers if they were aware of the existing test to diagnose cognitive trouble. |
| Conclusions/discovery?       | After the study, researchers thinks that AI will be soon a very usefull resource to help diagnose very complex diseases like AD. Furthermore, in Florida it appears that only one-fourth of the old poeple living in the senior certers where the study was leaded did preventing test to help diagnose AD. |
| Remaining questions?         | There is not remaning questions. |
