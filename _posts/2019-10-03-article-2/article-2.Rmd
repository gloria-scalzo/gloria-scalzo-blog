| General topic?               | A device using electromagnetics waves could enhance memory or reverse memory loss in Alzheimer's disease |
| Procedure/what was examined? |  |
| Conclusions/discovery?       |  |
| Remaining questions?         | There is a new research related to this one to know if there are side effects in the long term treatment with the MemorEMTM device. This research take part on 150 subjects. If the trial is succesfull, then company will propose their device to the FDA for approval in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.  |
