| General topic?               | A device using electromagnetic waves could enhance memory or reverse memory loss in Alzheimer's disease |
| Procedure/what was examined? | The company NeuroEM Therapeutics did a clinical trial on eight patients with mild to moderate AD. The trial showed an enhance of cognitive performance in the case of seven patients.  Before testing their MemorEMTM head device on humans, they did several of test on mice that reveled treating them with elctromagnetics waves in the radiofrequency interval could improve their cognitive performance.  For humans, they used the same treatment but with a portable head device, the memorEMTM head device. It is a hat with several of emitters inside. The treatment was given by a caregiver, who is a relative, member or the family,... and was administered at the house of the patient.  The researshers have now some evidence that electromagnetic waves are affecting AD, it can stop and reverse the memory loss caused by the disease. Actually, the electromagnetic waves can get into brain cells and target A-beta and tau proteins, which are responsable of the Alzheimer's disease.  |
| Conclusions/discovery?       | After only two month of treatment, seven of the eight patients had an increase of cognitive performance in the ADAS-cog score of four point. Furthermore, there were no harmfull secondary effets and no tumors or brain bleadings revelead in the brain scans of the eight patients.  Two months of treatment lead to a throw back in time of one year, speaking of memory loss and the recover of memory was maintained even two weeks after the treatment was finished. Brain scans also showed an amelioration of communication between neurons in the cingulate cortex. |
| Remaining questions?         | There is a new research related to this one to know if there are side effects in the long term treatment with the MemorEMTM device. This research take part on 150 subjects. If the trial is succesfull, then company will propose their device to the FDA for approval in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.  |
