| General topic?               | How GENUS can influence brain rhythm |
| Procedure/what was examined? | Neuroscientists of the MIT discovered that Gamma Entrainment Using Sensory stimuli (GENUS) could improve our knowledges of the brain and may be a treatment in Alzheimer’s disease. GENUS is a proceed using flickering light and sound stimuli. Researches on mice affected with the Alzheimer’s disease demonstrated that the accumulation of amyloid and tau proteins in the visual cortex have significantly decreased with a one hour/day exposition for a week to a 40 Hz light flickering. After that, they found that sound stimulation affects the hippocampus as well as the auditory cortex. The
  hippocampus is the region of the brain for learning and memory.   |
| Conclusions/discovery?       | It appears that mice under GENUS treatment did better memory tests than control mice. Another trial proved that mice affected with the Alzheimer’s that were under GENUS for three to six weeks had an improve of memory. Their neurons died in smaller quantities and were making more synapses than the controls. Following the results, Li-Huei Tsai explained that a longer exposal to GENUS could really slow down the accumulation of amyloid and tau proteins in the cortex. The lab then started a human trial and Tsai showed some preliminary results that indicated an increase of gamma rhythm in the brain of healthy people. On another side, the team also worked on how the brain rhythm can affects the work of the brain. It appears that an exposal to GENUS causes changes in neurons, microglia and brain’s vasculature. The Alzheimer affected mice have a slower transport of biochemical information, but with GENUS, this function improved. They put forwards the same effects in microglial cells, it released less inflammatory markers. Another recent study showed that an audio stimulation with genius bind amyloid proteins with another protein which goes to the vessels, thus, out of the brain. It could be the way to rid the brain of amyloid proteins. |
