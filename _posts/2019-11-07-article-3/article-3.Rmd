| General topic?               | Resistance to Alzheimer's disease |
| Procedure/what was examined? | Researchers have found that some kind of gene variants may delay early-onset Alzheimer's disease in the population of poeple who carry genes that usualy cause AD in a young age. They found, on only one patient, two copies of a gene variation called APOE3ch. The other members of the patient's family didn't had this gene variation in two copies and only 6 percent of his relative had one copy of the APOE3ch. The last ones develop AD symptoms at the age of 45. A CT of the patient's brain showed that there was not so much signs of neurodegeneration. The two marks of AD are amyloid beta deposits and tau tangles, the first one was really high in the patient's brain, but the other one was low. |
| Conclusions/discovery?       | Researchers think that having twice the gene variation APOE3ch may delay early-onset AD because it may be able to limit tau pathology. An investigator said that we could now focus on resistance to Alzheimer's disease to treat patients instead of finding a way to avoid it. In fact APOE3ch may reduce the afinity of apolipoprotein (which is a protein involved in the metabolism of fat) for some kind of sugars (HSPG) which are modulating the two marks of AD (amyloid beta and tau proteins). So, the artificial modulating of the link that bind APOE and HSPG could lead to a "treatment" for AD.  |
