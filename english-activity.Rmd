Every time I travel, I speek English. 
I always watch my favorite series in ENglish, like Grey's Anatomy, Hawaii 5-0, Friends, Game of Thrones, and MANY others. 
During bleusailles, at the beginning of the scool year, I had the chance to speek with an old man in English. I think he was a veteran in USA. He comes every year in Belgium from USA to assist to bleusailles in Mons. The value he insited most was respect, respect for others but first of all, respect of yourself, if you don't respect yourself, you can't respect others.
